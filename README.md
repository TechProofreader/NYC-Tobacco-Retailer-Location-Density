# NYC Tobacco Retailer Location Density per Borough
***This repository contains some analysis on publicly available NYC data relating to Tobacco Retailer location density per borough.***

### I conducted this research and analysis for a few reasons:

1) To highlight a concern relating to NYC Public Health.

2) To educate people on the importance of this data.

3) To teach people about Data Science.

While analyzing some publicly available data from the NYC government, I uncovered the fact that Tobacco Retailers are the second largest small business industry in NYC. Holding a small business market share of 11%, they represent around 5,209 small buinesses throughout the five boroughs of the Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan, Queens, and Staten Island.

### After conducting some further analysis on the data, I determined the density of Tobacco Retailers per square-mile for each borough:

* Manhattan: 69 Tobacco Retailers per square-mile

* Bronx: 27 Tobacco Retailers per square-mile

* Brooklyn: 22 Tobacco Retailers per square-mile

* Queens: 13 Tobacco Retailers per square-mile

* Staten Island: 5 Tobacco Retailers per square-mile

Note: I have removed the Longitude and Latitude coordinates of the retailer locations from the visualization for privacy reasons.

### Key Takeaways From This Data

* There are more than enough Tobacco Retailers in NYC, perhaps too many.
* In-order to encourage healthier lifestyle choices of its residents, the NYC government should restrict any further Tobacco Retailer licenses.
* Further analysis is needed to uncover why certain boroughs like Manhattan, Brooklyn, and the Bronx have high densities, whereas Queens and Staten Island have much lower densities.
* Further analysis is needed to determine if there are any correlations between NYC resident health data and Tobacco Retailer densities.
* Further analysis is needed to determine any possible economic effects on the NYC economy relating to limiting and/or reducing Tobacco Retailer licenses.
